# Map Table (WIP)

Dvalin is my little Valheim modding framework I'm working on and this is my first real thing, a map table!

## Usage

The map table is in the 'Misc' section in the hammer.

When placed you can use it to add your exploration to the map, and vice versa.

I haven't had time to test this with multiple players yet, but if you do please report any issues.
